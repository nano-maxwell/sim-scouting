# Documentation
## Firebase
Working with the best free database:
- SERVER SIDE (backend/server.js)
--
  - implementation of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) and [express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html)
  - GET to "/debug": works with debug.tsx. just delivers which uid's to allow
  - POST to "/write": writes to theh database
  >[!WARNING]
  >to write you must submit a JSON.
  - POST to "/read": reads documents. submit a path
  - POST to "/signup": creates users
  - POST to "/login": fetches hashed passwords to authenticate users
  - POST to "/register": make user
-

### Requests  
Every request on the server side has 2 properties: req (request), and res (response). by using app.use(express.json()), both of these properties will be jsons. [Request types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods).
- CLIENT SIDE (frontend/src/scripts/firebase.tsx)
--
  - Most of the functions simply make a post request to server.js, except
  - register(): uses sha256 to encrypt passwords. If you don't know what this does, ask Ms. Meyer, and say sam sent you
